4.2 Examples of Induction on Natural Numbers
Exercise 1
Let a be an arbitrary real number. Prove, for all natural numbers m and n,
that a^(m*n) = (a^m)^n

P(m,n) = (a^(m*n) = (a^m)^n)

Using x^0 = 1 and x*x^n = x^(n+1)

Base cases:
Prove P(0,n):
     a^(0*n) = (a^0)^n -> a^0 = 1^n -> 1 = 1
Prove P(m,0):
     a^(m*0) = (a^m)^0 -> a^0 = 1 -> 1 = 1
Therefore, P(0,n) and P(m,0)

Induction cases:
Prove P(m,n) -> P(m+1,n)
a^((m+1)*n) = a^(m*n+n)
     = a^(m*n)*a^n
     = (a^m)^n*a^n a^(m*n) -> (a^m)^n from induction hypothesis
     = (a^m*a)^n
     = (a^(m+1))^n
P(m,n) -> P(m+1,n)

Prove P(m,n) -> P(m,n+1)
a^(m*(n+1)) = a^(m*n+m)
     = a^(m*n)*a^m
     = (a^m)^n*a^m
     = (a^m)^(n+1)
P(m,n) -> P(m,n+1)

Exercise 2
Prove that the sum of the first n odd positive numbers is n^2.

Define odd numbers by 2*n+1 for n = 0 ...
P(n) = sum (2*i+1)^2 from 0 to n = n^2

Base case:
P(0) = sum 2*i+1 from 0 to 1 = 1^2
     = 2*0 + 1 = 1^2
     = 1 = 1
Therefore, P(0).

Inductive case:
P(n) = sum 2*i-1 from 0 to n = n^2
P(n+1) = sum 2*i-1 from 0 to n+1
     = sum 2*i-1 from 0 to n + 2*(n+1)-1
     = n^2 + 2n + 1
     = (n+1)^2
P(n) -> P(n+1)

Exercise 3
I believe the book is incorrect and the series should start at i=0.
Prove that sum a^i from i=0 to n = (a^(n+1)-1)/(a-1), where a is a real
     number and a /= 1.

P(0) = 1 = (a^(0+1)-1)/(a-1) 
     = (a-1)/(a-1) 
     = 1
Therefore, P(0).

Inductive case:
P(n) = sum a^i from i=0 to n = (a^(n+1)-1)/(a-1)
P(n+1) = sum a^i from i=0 to n+1 = sum a^i from i=0 to n + a^(n+1)
     = (a^(n+1)-1)/(a-1) + a^(n+1)
     = ((a^(n+1)-1) + a^(n+1)(a-1))/(a-1)
     = (a^(n+1)-1 + a^(n+2)-a^(n+1))/(a-1)
     = (a^(n+2)-1)/(a-1)
P(n) -> P(n+1)

4.3 Induction and Recursion
Exercise 4

>fib :: Integer -> Integer
>fib 0 = 0
>fib 1 = 1
>fib (n+2) = fib n + fib (n+1)

Prove sum fib i from i to n = (fib n+2) - 1

Base case: P(0)
P(0) = sum fib 0 from 1 to 0 = (fib n+2) - 1
     0 = (fib 0+2) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0
Therefore, P(0)

Inductive case: P(n) -> P(n+1)
P(n) = sum fib i from 1 to n = (fib n+2) - 1
P(n+1) = sum fib i from 1 to n+1 = (fib n+3) - 1

(fib n+3) - 1 
     = (fib n+1 + fib n+2) - 1               {fib.3}
     = (fib n+2) - 1 + fib n+1
     = sum fib i from 1 to n + fib n+1       {hypothesis}
     = sum fib i from 1 to n+1               {def. sum}
P(n) -> P(n+1)

4.6 Functional Equality

Theorem 25. map f . concat = concat (map (map f)).

Exercise 10. Prove Theorem 25.
Proof. The theorem states that two functions are equal. Therefore, we use the
definition of extensional equality of functions; thus we choose an arbitrary 
list of lists xss, and we must prove that 

map f (concat xss) = concat (map (map f) xss). 

This has been proved by Theorem 22.

4.8 Limitations of Induction

Exercise 14. xss must be composed of finite lists. If xs in (xs:xss) is not
finite, concat.2 will occur indefinitely.

Exercise 15.

Theorem 27. reverse . reverse = id

>reverse :: [a] -> [a]
>reverse []     = []
>reverse (x:xs) = reverse xs ++ [x]

reverse . reverse [1,2,3]
     = reverse (reverse [1,2,3])
     = reverse (reverse [2,3] ++ [1])
     = reverse (reverse [3] ++ [2] ++ [1])

     = [] ++ [1] ++ [2] ++ [3]

     = id [1,2,3]

Exercise 16. Prove reverse (xs++ys) = reverse ys ++ reverse xs
Then decide whether this list theorem happens to be true for infinite
lists like [1..].

Proof. By induction over xs. The base case:

reverse ([]++ys)
     = reverse ys                                    { (++).1 }
     = reverse ys ++ []                              { (++).2 }
     = reverse ys ++ reverse []                      { reverse.1 }

The inductive case. The hypothesis is 
reverse (xs++ys) = reverse ys ++ reverse xs

reverse ((x:xs)++ys)
     = reverse (x : (xs++ys))                        { (++).2 }
     = reverse (xs++ys) ++ [x]                       { reverse.2 }
     = reverse ys ++ reverse xs ++ [x]               { hypothesis }
     = reverse ys ++ reverse (x:xs)                  { reverse.2 }
QED

This list theorem does not work for infinite lists like [1..]. It will be
impossible for reverse (xs++ys) : x to complete operation since 
reverse (xs++ys) is an infinitely long list and cannot be prepended to
another list.

Exercise 17. Prove Theorem 27. reverse . reverse xs = xs.

Proof. By induction. The base case.

reverse . reverse []
     = reverse (reverse [])                          { (.) }
     = reverse []                                    { reverse.1 }
     = []                                            { reverse.1 }

The inductive case. The hypothesis is reverse . reverse xs = xs.

reverse . reverse (x:xs)
     = reverse (reverse (x:xs))                      { (.) }
     = reverse (reverse xs ++ [x])                   { reverse.2 }

Exercise 19. length (concat xss) = sum (map length xss)

Also proven in Exercise 12.

Proof by induction. The base case.

length (concat [])
     = length []                                     { concat.1 }
     = 0                                             { length.1 }
     = sum []                                        { sum.1 }
     = map length []                                 { map.1 }

The inductive case. The hypothesis is length (concat xss) = sum (map length xss).

length (concat (xs:xss)) =
     = length (xs ++ concat xss)                     { concat.2}
     = length xs + length (concat xss)               { Theorem 16 }
     = length xs + sum (map length xss)              { hypothesis }
     = sum (length xs : map length xss)              { sum.2 }
     = sum (map length (xs:xss))                     { map.2 }

>and, or          :: [Bool] -> Bool
>and              =  foldr (&&) True
>or               =  foldr (||) False

Exercise 20. Prove that or xs returns True if True is one element in xs.

Proof. Assume xs is of type [Bool], it has n+1 elements, and True is one 
element in xs.

P(n) = or xs = True

By induction. The base case. (n = 0)

or xs
        = or [True]                             { xs = [True] }
        = foldr (||) False ([True])             { or }
        = (||) True (foldr (||) False [])       { foldr.2 }
        = (||) True (False)                     { foldr.2}
        = True                                  { (||) }

The inductive case.

or xs
        = foldr (||) False xs                   { or }
        = foldr (||) False (y:ys)               { xs = (y:ys)}
        = (||) y (foldr (||) False ys)          { foldr.2 }
        = (||) y (or ys)                        { or }

There are two cases. Case 1: y = True

        = (||) True (or ys)                     { y = True }
        = True                                  { (||) }

Case 2: or ys = True

        = (||) y True                           { hypothesis }
        = True                                  { (||) }

Exercise 21. Prove that and xs returns True if all elements in xs are True.

P(n) = and xs = True

By induction. The base case. (n = 0)

or xs

        = True                                  { (&&) }

The inductive case. The hypothesis is and xs = True

or xs
        = foldr (&&) True xs                    { and }
        = foldr (&&) True (y:ys)                { xs = (y:ys)}

Exercise 22.

max x y = x     if x >= y
max x y = y     if y >= x

>maximum :: Ord a => [a] -> a
>maximum (x:xs) = foldr max x xs

Exercise 23. Prove that maximum has the following property:

(maximum xs) >= x

where x is an arbitrary element of xs.

Let xs = (x:xs')

Proof. By induction. Base case: Assume length xs' = 0 so that xs = (x:[]).

maximum xs
        = foldr max x []        { maximum }
        = x                     { foldr.1 }

In this case, (maximum xs) = x.

Inductive case. Assume the hypothesis (maximum xs) >= x.

maximum (x:x':xs')
        = foldr max x (x':xs') { maximum }
        = max x' (foldr max x xs') { foldr.2 }
        = max x' (maximum (x:xs')) { maximum }
        = max x' (maximum xs)   { xs = (x:xs') }

Case 1: (maximum xs) < x'

In this case, max x' (maximum xs) = x'. Therefore maximum (x':xs) = x'.

Case 2: (maximum xs) > x'

Here, max x' (maximum xs) = maximum xs. Therefore, maximum (x':xs) > x'.

Therefore, maximum (x:x':xs') >= x'.

Exercise 25. Prove concat = foldr (++) []. Assume finite lists for induction.

Proof. Using the extensional quality of functions, and taking an arbitrary, 
finite list of lists xss, with elements of finite lists, prove 
concat xss = foldr (++) [] xss.

By induction. The base case.

concat []
        = []                                    { concat.1 }
        = foldr (++) [] []                      { foldr.1 }

The inductive case. Assume concat xss = foldr (++) [] xss.

concat (xs:xss)
        = xs ++ concat xss                      { concat.2 }
        = (++) xs foldr (++) [] xss             { hypothesis }
